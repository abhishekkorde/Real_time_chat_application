# Real_time_chat_application
1.	Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to execute server-side code using JavaScript. Its non-blocking I/O model is well-suited for real-time applications.
2.	Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications.
3.	Socket.IO: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients over WebSocket connections. It gracefully falls back to other communication methods if WebSocket is not supported by the client or network.
4.	Front-End Technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to create the user interface. You might also use a front-end framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular to manage the UI components efficiently.

5.	Keep in mind that this is a broad overview, and the actual implementation details can be quite intricate.
6.	The key takeaway is that Node.js and Socket.IO provide the foundation for building a real-time chatting application that offers seamless communication between users.
